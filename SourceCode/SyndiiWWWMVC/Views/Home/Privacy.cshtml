            The Opilio Labs Inc. web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Opilio Labs Inc. pages, or register with Opilio Labs Inc. site or services, a cookie helps Opilio Labs Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Opilio Labs Inc. web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Opilio Labs Inc. features that you customized.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Opilio Labs Inc. services or web sites you visit.
